First, we took a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. 
After this, we inspected how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. 
Then, our focus shifted towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. 
Lastly, we took a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.

## Addition
After adding the notification styling to our phonebook, the application didn't look pretty as when you open the app an empty notification would showup for 5 seconds due to the setTimeOut function. 
So I conditionally applied classes to the notification and error message.
